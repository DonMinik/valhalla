# Valhalla (Game)
Valhalla is going to a be game that "simulates" a viking feast with all that it icludes.

This is going to be:
- drinking
- eating
- swearing
- fighting

The Idea is to have a round based game in which the player is rewarded with points for the actions above.

In the longrun it shall be a multiplayer party/LAN game. This means the rounds should not take longer than 10 minutes
and the players compete against / feast together in the same level.

## Disclaimer
This is a one man pet project. Therefore it is highly unlikely to be finished at any time.

## Ideas
- Different Characters:
    - strong characters can fight
    - thin ones have increased movement speed
    - bigger ones are able to eat more before puking 
    
- There is a limit on how much a character can dring / eat 
    - drinking / eating further will result in puking that gives minus points

- fighting is only able when the party is heaten up enough by alcohol and swears

- fighting agains other players offers them the chance to dodge and either run away or counter attack

- Setting: Nordish longhouse

- some sort of combo mechanics like drinking and beating another player with your horn of mead at the same time
